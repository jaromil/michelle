# Oh My WSL!

A delightful & open-source framework for the Windows Substystem for Linux

Oh My WSL aims to be a delightful, open source and community-driven framework for managing your WSL configuration, the way oh-my-zsh is for the Z Shell.
It will bundle a graphical service manager and helpful functions, helpers and a few things that make you shout... Oh My WSL!

Ease of installation is the first feature: run this command on any WSL distro to get started:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://oh-my-wsl.github.io/install.sh)"
```
