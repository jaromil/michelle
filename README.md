# A lovely shell setup called Michelle

A delightful & open-source shell setup for any Linux system, including WSL

Michelle aims to be a delightful, open source and community-driven framework for managing your shell configuration.

It will bundle a graphical service manager and helpful functions, helpers and a few things that make you shout... My Michelle!

## Requirements

Any GNU/Linux or WSL/Linux distribution can run Michelle, given the following requirements are installed:

- Zsh
- Python3 / pip
- Supervisor (also known as supervisord)
- Syncthing

Install them by hand on your own system or (TODO) use this script for a quick start:

```
curl -s https://github.com/dyne/michelle/requirements.sh | sudo bash
```

Installing requirements will need root permission.

## Install

Ease of installation is the first feature: run these 3 commands in any shell to get started:

(TODO)

```
curl -s https://github.com/jaromil/michelle/install.sh | zsh
```

This does not require root permission, will install everything in your HOME directory under `~/.michelle`
